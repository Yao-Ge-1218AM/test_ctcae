General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 27	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presented for week #27 of treatment with M7824, required  labs were completed.  Dr. Wooley reconciled all her home medication, performed the physical exam, and assessed for adverse events.  His findings are documented in the patients progress note.    Dr. Floudas met with patient, reviewed labs, reported adverse events, and current status.  He discussed her recent oral mucositis symptoms which have resolved after treatment with oral steroids.  The rash she had previously has spread to her bilateral lower extremities and her trunk.  She does have a dermatology consult today to evaluate this rash. Her prior complaint of rectal bleeding has resolved.  All her labs results today are within normal limits, any abnormalities, unless addressed or treated, were not clinically significant.  Due to the increased spread of the skin rash, and continuing facial nerve disorder, Dr. Strauss and Dr. Floudas have decided to hold her week # 27 dose of M7824 for this week.  Research nurse reinforced that patient should contact treatment team if her status changes or her current symptoms get worst.  Patient will continue on oral steroid at 20 mg daily, then start 10 mg daily in a few days when the prior dose is completed. Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks  for Week # 29 clinic visit.  All adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Strauss and Dr. Floudas.

Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week #31	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents, accompanied by her family, for week #31 of treatment with M7824, required restaging scans and labs were completed.  Dr. Samour reconciled all her home medication, performed the physical exam, and assessed for adverse events.  His findings are documented in the patients progress note.    Dr. Strauss met with patient, reviewed labs, adverse events, and current status. Dr. Strauss discussed results of restaging scans with patient and her husband, she continues to have stable, partial response with the M7824.  Patient continues with rash to extremities, some areas much improved but rash still present.  Dr. Strauss advised patient that he will continue to hold the M7824, because rash has not resolved.  He discussed that her disease is stable radiographically, thus holding the study drug to prevent further toxicities or recurrence of prior toxicities would be best at this time as protocol allows.   Labs results are all within normal limits; abnormal results are not clinically significant.  Patient will be tapered from the oral steroids, thus Cortisol stimulation test was ordered for today, her last 5 mg dose was taken yesterday. Research nurse reinforced that patient should contact treatment team if her status changes.  Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks  for Week # 33 clinic visit.  All adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Strauss.

Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents accompanied by her husband for week # 9 of the HPV Trap protocol; her required routine and research labs were collected.  Dr. Mian performed her physical assessment, reconciled her concomitant medications, reviewed all prior adverse events and new complaints.  His findings are documented in the patients progress note.  Dr. Sater met with patient and reviewed her adverse events, symptoms, and symptom management.  Patient admits she is not taking the long acting morphine every twelve hours as prescribed; she only takes it once at night and not the morning dose. She also does not take the short acting narcotic for breakthrough, she only takes Tylenol or an NSAID.  Research nurse reinforced that not taking the morning dose of the long acting narcotis is setting her up for rebound pain, which she admits she experiences at night.  Research nurse suggested patient try taking the prescribed dose of the long acting pain medication twice daily for the next 7 days to see if she gets better pain relief.  Patient agrees she will try. Based todays labs which are within normal limits and her current status, Dr. Sater has approved her treatment of M7824 for week #9. Patient will return in two weeks for clinic and treatment for week #11.  Research nurse reinforced that patient should call her treatment team if her status changes.  Adverse Events Summary to follow in another progress note.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 21	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents accompanied by her husband for week #21 clinic visit, all required labs were drawn.   NP Gloria Jackson, performed her physical assessment, reconciled her concomitant medications, and reviewed her prior and new adverse events complaints.  Her findings are documented in the patient progress note.    Dr. Strass and Dr. Brownell from dermatology, met with them both,  reviewed all the adverse events with patient and discussed her current status.  Patient continues to have pruritus, which is related to the M7824; she has lesions on her torso, legs, and arms.  She continually itches the areas, causing skin breakage and bleeding. Dr. Brownell assessed her skin and reviewed the medications he had prescribed for her.  Patient states she stopped taking the oral Acitretin which was ordered on 04/16/19.  She took it for about 5 days, but stopped after experiencing external ear discomfort, including a burning sensation and then subsequent peeling.  She states the burning sensation resolved immediately after she stopped the Acitretin.  As of todays visit all external ear symptoms have resolved.  Dr. Strauss discussed the next steps in her treatment, including patient possibly going off treatment and starting chemotherapy or another clinical trial.    Due to her current issue with continued pruritis, Dr. Strauss advised patient he will start her on an oral steroid course for 2 weeks.  She will return to clinic in 2 weeks for follow up and an early restaging scan to evaluate her disease.  The M7824 dose will be held at this time.  All adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Strauss.

He states the tightness did not affect his ADLs and he performed his normal exercise without any difficulties; this tightness resolved after 2 days.  He had onset of rash with itching, as noted in the NPs progress note, around day 3 post treatment, and it is ongoing today.  Dermatology was called, came and consulted with the team and patient in the exam room.  Dr. Brownell suggested topical scalp spray Fluocinonide, topical skin cream Triamcinolone, and Hydroxyzine for his rash and itching; these were all ordered.  Patient describes itching as mild and tolerable, it does not affect his sleep.    Dr. Strauss reviewed labs results, most were within normal limits; those with abnormal findings, if not addressed were not clinically significant.  Baseline labs abnormalities remain stable or have improved.  Dr. Strauss has approved week #3 dose of M7824, the patient will receive his infusion tomorrow morning in the Day Hospital.  Patient will return in 2 weeks for clinic and treatment.  Research nurse reinforced that he should call if his skin symptoms become worst.  All adverse events were discussed with Dr. Strauss.

Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week #19	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presented yesterday, accompanied by his wife, for week #19 clinic and treatment;  restaging scans and required routine labs were completed.  Dr. Jenkins reconciled all home medications, assessed for adverse events, and performed the patients physical exam. Her findings are documented in the patients progress note.  Dr. Abdul Sater met with patient, reviewed lab results, reported adverse events and patients current status.  He discussed the results of the restaging scan, which continue to be stable, with a mixed response.   Patients prior report of reoccurrence of his bronchial/bronchiectasis symptoms have all resolved.  He did receive pre/post IV hydration prophylaxis due to his history of acute renal insufficieny (AKI) and receiving CT contrast dye for his scans today.  His lab results were within normal limits; his anemia continues to be stable, the labs today were drawn post his IV pre-hydration in preparation for his CT scans, thus his hemoglobin may have been dilutional.  The CBC lab was repeated and his hemoglobin was 8.0 mg/dl; he was asymptomatic for anemia thus Dr. Abdul Sater decided not to transfuse him. His serum creatinine continues to be stable.  All other lab abnormalities are stable based on baseline. His bisphosphonate therapy was switched from Zometa to Denosumab (Xgeva) because it is not nephrotoxic compared to the Zometa.  Research nurse provided patient with teaching handout on the Xgeva; reinforcing calcium with vitamin D supplementation.  Dr. Abdul Sater advised patient to increase his oral calcium supplementation to twice daily.    Based on patients current status Dr. Abdul Sater did approved week # 19 dose of M7824 treatment which was given today.  Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for week #21 clinic and treatment.  Research nurse advised patient to call if his status changes.   He was also given a copy of his current lab results so his local oncologist will follow up on his anemia status at his schedule lab draw next week.

Reason For Visit	Follow up symptom management	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient emailed treatment team on Friday, 2/1/19, stating that she was having loose stool, about 12 times a day, which is above her baseline of 4-6 formed stools per day.  She states the increased stools started on 1/23/19, the day after she received the Neupogen injection; however it was not a concern at the time because the stools were formed and sometimes she does have more stools than baseline depending on what she eats.  However on the weekend of 1/26/19, she noticed consistency change to very soft and loose.  She started to have stools whenever she went to the bathroom to urinate; she denies watery diarrhea, but does report intermittent mild abdominal cramping with the loose stools.  Dr. Strauss did contact patient on Friday, 2/1/19; and suggested she report to her local oncologist for labs and stool sample, which she did.    Research nurse emailed patient today, requesting she have her oncologist office fax a copy of the lab results from Friday.  Patient states her symptoms have improved and she will have the oncologist office fax us the labs results.  She said the stool samples have not resulted yet.

Dr. Gatti-Mays communicated with the patient, advised patient that she agreed with her plan and requested that she contact the team with the outcome of her visit.   This morning the patient emailed a copy of the urgent care clinic summary from yesterday; she had a urinalysis, urine culture was sent, which is still pending. She was prescribed Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (Bactrim), dose 200-40 mg/5 ml liquid, 5 ml orally, twice a day for a 7 day course. In her communication with Dr. Gatti-Mays this morning, she is still asymptomatic, and the color of her urine is clearing up.

	Agree with above. When I spoke with Ms X this morning, she denies any visible blood clots in the urine - just pink urine. She reports worsening of her baseline frequency, urgency and incontinence at the onset of symptoms which have now improved. I discussed with her that we have seen some bleeding/oozing from patients on M7824 and specifically that we have seen this in patients who have received prior radiation. She has had prior pelvic RT during her initial treatment for her anal cancer.   She knows that if her symptoms worsen, she develops blood clots, or she has any other concerns she should contact us immediately. She will follow-up with us on Wednesday when her urine cx is resulted.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 17	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents for week # 17 of the HPV Trap protocol accompanied by her husband; required  labs were collected. Dr. Sheth performed her physical assessment, reconciled her concomitant medications, and reviewed all prior and new adverse events.  His findings are documented in the patient's progress note.    Dr. Abdul Sater met with the patient, he reviewed the adverse events and patient's current status. She states she is still having mild forgetfulness since returning from her vacation 2 weeks ago; she may forget parts of a recipe she has used in the pass or where she placed an item. Dr. Abdul Sater, suggested we add a CT Brain to her restaging scan at her next visit. Patient is agreeable with this.   Dr. Abdul Sater reviewed her labs for today; her ANC is 600 today, so the plan is for her to receive Neulasta after her infusion today.  Due to her history of sensitivity reactions of chills/rigors and diarrhea with abdominal cramping with Neulasta and Neupogen, she will be prescribed medications to take home to treat these symptoms if they occur.  Her anemia is also stable, and she has a slight elevation in her serum calcium, which is not clinically significant, will continue to monitor.  Based on her status and her labs being within normal limits, Dr. Abdul Sater has approved her week # 17 M7824 treatment for today.  Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for restaging scans, full body photography, clinic visit and treatment.  Research nurse reinforced to patient to call her research team if her status changes.  All adverse events were reviewed and discussed with Dr. Abdul Sater.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week #21	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents for week # 21 of the HPV Trap protocol accompanied by her husband; required labs were completed. Dr. Khan performed the physical assessment, reconciled all concomitant medications, and reviewed all prior and new adverse events.  Her findings are documented in the patients progress note.    Dr. Gatti-Mays met with the patient, she reviewed the labs,  adverse events and patients current status.  Patient states she has been using the creams prescribed from the last visit on her rash; and this has helped to decrease the intensity of the itching.  She states the oral Emend did not help with the itching, so Dr. Gatti-Mays advised her that Hydroxyzine will be added and the Emend discontinued.  Dr. Gatti-May discussed the dosing which would be as needed every 8 hours. She also discussed the possible side effects of the medication, suggesting patient should not drive after first dose so she can see how the medication affects her.  Based on labs results, she is Neutropenic, and patient will receive Neulasta today after her infusion.  She will be prescribed the one dose of Meperidine to use for the rigors she experiences 5-6 hours post the Neulasta injection, due to her intolerance of the growth factor.  Patient states, this regimen did help after her last Neulasta 4 weeks ago.  All other lab results which are abnormal are stable based on baseline history, and are not clinically significant.  Dr. Gatti-Mays approved the M7824 treatment for today.  She reinforced Neutropenic precautions and advised patient to call if her status changes.  Dermatology will she patient while she is in the Day Hospital for a follow up a skin assessment.  Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for week 23 clinic and treatment visit.     All adverse events were reviewed and discussed with Dr. Gatti-Mays.

Dr. DeMaria performed the physical assessment, reconciled all concomitant medications, and reviewed all prior and new adverse events.  His findings are documented in the patient's progress note. The M7824 study drug has been on hold since 9/3/19, visit, due to fatigue; this hold will continue at this time.  Hematology consult and subsequent bone marrow biopsy has confirmed a diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).   Dr. Gattime-Mays met with the patient, she reviewed her lab results,  adverse events, and patient's current status.  She advised patient of results of her restaging scan, which continues to show a good response to the study drug. Prior report of muscle cramps and dizziness has resolved. With the sudden need for transfusions due to anemia within the last month, Dr. Gatti-Mays discussed with patient the possibility that the Acitretin medication is also contributing to her increased anemia, in addition to her MDS diagnosis. She discussed reducing the Acitretin dose to 10 mg daily, with plans to eventually discontinue the drug.  Patient and her husband are agreeable with this. Patient will receive blood transfusion today for her anemia.  The plan is for her to have her local oncologist follow her CBC at home, with a repeat of the lab in one week, to monitor her anemia and WBC count.  Dr. Gatti-Mays discussed patient finding a Hematologist in her area to follow her MDS now that is has been diagnosed.  Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for week # 39 clinic visit.   All adverse events were reviewed and discussed with Dr. Gatti-Mays.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 51 Completed Protocol Treatment	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents for week # 51 accompanied by her husband; required routine and research labs, restaging scan and EKG were completed.  Dr. DeMaria performed the physical assessment, reconciled all concomitant medications, and assessed all prior and new adverse events.  His findings are documented in the patient's progress note.  This is th last visit as part of the required treatment phase of the protocol.  Patient's last treatment dose with M7824 08/20/19, prior to drug hold starting on 09/03/19.     Dr. Gatti-Mays met with the patient, reviewed her lab results,  adverse events, and patient's current status.  Dr.  Gatti-Mays reviewed the results of her restaging scan, patient continues to have a complete response to the M7824 treatment. Lab results are within normal limits except for expected white blood cell abnormalities based on her MDS diagnosis.  Her hemoglobin is stable and within normal limits after Acitretin was discontinued; thus her prior anemia was probably related to the Acitretin which was used to treat her Keratoacanthoma skin lesions.  The follow up plan will be clinic and restaging scans visits every 12 weeks per protocol.  Dr. Gatti-Mays stressed that patient can contact team if her status changes and she needs to come in for earlier visits.   Patient will continue to be followed by her local oncologist for supportive care for her MDS.   All adverse events were reviewed and discussed with Dr. Gatti-Mays.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Follow Up # 1	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents for her first follow up visit post her EOT on 01/07/20; required routine labs and restaging scan completed.  Dr. Pegna performed the physical assessment, reconciled all concomitant medications, and assessed all prior and new adverse events.  His findings are documented in the patients progress note.      Dr. Strauss and the research nurse spoke with patient via teleconference with Dr. Pegna.  Dr. Strauss reviewed her labs, adverse events, and current status.  He discussed the results of her restaging scan which shows she continues to have a complete response to the M7824.   Patient does report a new Keratoacanthoma lesion above her left eyelid, onset about 2 weeks ago.  She states it is basically asymptomatic except for an occasional itch; she uses the prescribed Tretinoin ointment as needed.  Her prior reports of rash to her waist and memory (fog) impairment have all resolved.  Lab results are within normal limits except for expected white blood cell abnormalities based on her MDS diagnosis.  Dr. Strauss discussed her low ANC of 380 today and  reinforced neutropenic precautions.  He also recommended she contact her Hematologist at JHU to provide them with a copy of her lab result from today.   Patient will continue to be followed by her local oncologist and JHU hematologist for supportive care for her MDS.  Dr. Strauss advised her to call the research team if her KA lesion starts to get worst requiring dermatology interventions.  The patient will return to clinic in 3 months for restaging and follow up visit # 2.   All adverse events were reviewed and discussed with Dr. Strauss.

She has also noticed mild, bleeding at intestinal stoma site when she cleans the site and changes her appliance; there were no visible clots and bleeding resolves with application of new appliance.  The patient did have a PET/CT scan yesterday prior to her Radiation Oncology consult; this scan was to aid in the decision whether give palliative radiation for rectal pain.  The decision was made not to radiate at this time.  Her lab results are within normal limits, her increased alkaline phosphatase and ALT will be monitored.  Any other lab abnormalities which were not addressed are not clinically significant.  The patient was advised to discontinue use of Ibuprofen for pain, she was given a prescription of Oxycodone, which she has used in the past and it was effective for her pain. Based on her current status Dr. Strauss has approved week # 9 of M7824 infusion.  The patient will return in 2 weeks for clinic and early restating scan (4 weeks) to re-evaluate/confirm prior disease progression seen on the week # 7 restaging scan.  She will also have a liver Ultra Sound and liver biopsy at the next visit; the prep for these two procedures were discussed, including stopping all NSAID's 7 days prior to the biopsy.  Research nurse reinforced  to call her treatment team if her status changes.  All adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Strauss.

Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week #5	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient accompanied by her husband presents for week #5 study visit; required routine labs were completed.  Gloria Jackson, DNP, reconciled all home medications, reviewed all prior and new adverse events, and performed the physical assessment.  Her findings are documented in the patient progress note.  The patient was recently discharged, on 08/06/19, from the hospital after having surgery for partial cord compression, with laminectomy and tumor resection to L2-L4, affecting her right lower extremity.  She is scheduled to receive radiation for two weeks, starting today, for a sacral mass, that is affecting her left lower extremity, as described in the neurosurgery progress notes prior to her discharge.  She is currently on oral steroids, and her M7824 study drug will be held during her radiation treatment, starting with this week's dose # 5.  Dr. Abdul Sater met with patient, reviewed today's lab results, reviewed reported adverse events, and patient's current status.  She will receive IV hydration, for continued dehydration, general deconditioning, unrelieved fatigue, and tachycardia. She is also constipated, with last bowel movement 9 days ago; she will restart lactulose, which she had stopped taking.  Patient will be here daily for radiation, advised to contact team if she feels she needs supportive care.  All adverse events reviewed with Dr. Abdul Sater

Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week #7 Visit on 08/27/19	
		
Protocol  Documentation	Patient yesterday, 08/27/19,  accompanied by her husband and Mother for week #7 study visit; required restaging scans, routine and research labs were completed.  Dr. Carter, reconciled all home medications, reviewed all prior and new adverse events, and performed the physical assessment.  Her findings are documented in the patient progress note.  The patient's M7824 treatment has been on hold due to recent spinal surgery and radiation therapy.  Her last M7824 treatment date was 07/29/19.  Patient was on a steroids related to her recent surgical procedure; her dose was tapered and she took her last dose of steroids on 08/26/19, as directed by Radiation Oncologist.   Dr. Abdul Sater met with patient, reviewed today's lab results, reviewed reported adverse events, and patient's current status.  She continued to have severe fatigue, decreased appetite, and tachycardia, as noted in Dr. Carter's assessment.  Dr. Abdul Sater discussed these continued issues with patient and the decision was made to admit the patient to the inpatient unit for further clinical work up and evaluation.    Dr. Strauss and Dr. Abdul Sater reviewed the results of her restaging scan, which showed disease progression compared to baseline scan.  She also has tumor affecting her arteries and near her heart, which is causing her continued tachycardia.  Other than severe fatigue she has no cardiac symptoms at this time.  They met with the patient and her family and explained the scan results.  They had the discussion about what the next steps for treatment would be based on patient's wishes.  They also advised that Dr. Thomas wanted to discuss another clinical trial with the patient and her family.  The patient and her husband advised they will think about their options and discuss this with the team at a later date.  Plan is for cardiology consults, cortisol stimulation test, nutrition consult, and pain/palliative care consult.  The week 7 dose of M7824 will not be given.  All adverse events reviewed with Dr. Abdul Sater

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 7	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presented accompanied by his wife for week # 7 clinic visit, required labs were collected.  His week #7 restaging scans were delayed to be performed in 2 weeks at week 9, due to recent scans he had done at home.  His M7824 treatment was held at week # 5 due to complaint of dyspnea with for which oral steroid was started.  Dr. Carter reconciled his home medications, assessed for adverse events and performed his physical exam.  Her findings are documented in the patient progress note.  Dr. Floudas met with patient, reviewed his lab results, adverse events, and current status.  The patient continues to have dyspnea, which is not improving; he had stopped his steroids in error about a week ago.  The lab results where within normal limits; abnormalities which were not addressed are not clinically significant. He was started on Synthroid for his increased TSH. His rising liver enzymes which are  slightly above baseline will be monitored.    Based on his current status, Dr. Floudas advised patient that the M7824 study drug would be held for week # 7 due to his worsening dyspnea.  A pulmonary consult was requested and completed.  Restaging scans were added on for this visit after patient was assessed today, however both CT scanners were down.  The steroid, Prednisone was ordered restart for today with instructions not to stop until a phone call assessment by one of research team attending physicians.  The plan is for patient to return in 2 weeks for restaging scans, Echocardiogram, pulmonary function test and clinic.  Dr. Floudas reinforced that patient should contact his local oncologist or go to ED if his symptoms gets worst.  All adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Floudas.

Protocol  Documentation	Lab work reviewed, and physical exam completed by physician. Abnormal labs and clinical symptoms noted but none are considered clinically significant/SAE/AESI  unless otherwise noted in physician and RN notes. All AEs and attributions reviewed and approved by attending physician.   Patient was unable to attend previously scheduled dental surgery/tooth extraction on 4/24/19 due to flu like symptoms at that time. Awaiting dental clinic contact to re-schedule procedure.   Patient states the scheduled stool softeners have been very effective with her bowel movements and she has not had any anal hemorrhaging (blood on bathroom tissue when wiping) in approximately 5 weeks. She also clarifies that the Pantoprazole has made her chronic Gastritis much easier and that she no longer has sporadic episodes of fecal incontinence. Flu like symptoms resolved ~4 days after they began two weeks ago and her wound dehiscence  has scabbed over with no overt signs of infection at this time per physicians evaluation. Discussed with patient that working part time as waitress on her feet for long periods of time is perhaps not beneficial to leg edema and wound healing. Patient states she has been considering looking for alternative work position.  Patient treatment will continue to be held today, see prescriber note for details. Patient will see dermatology for suture removal on her leg once discharged from study clinic. Patient verbalized agreement and understanding with plan. Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks per protocol schedule.

Protocol  Documentation	Patient presented for week 49 follow up yesterday, her M7824 has been on hold due to Keratoacanthomas; required labs were collected and restaging CT scan was completed.  Dr. Abdul Sater performed her physical exam, reconciled her concomitant medications; reviewed all prior and current adverse events.  His findings are documented in the patient's progress notes.  He reviewed her restaging scan results, as documented in his progress note; the next steps as far as her treatment was discussed. He completed teaching on Acitretin, which will be prescribed to patient when she restates the HPV Trap study drug, to help prevent Keratoacanthomas.  Patient will return tomorrow for full body photography, as required by Dr. Brownell of Dermatology, with each restaging time point.  She will also have fasting lipid panel collected in preparation for starting the Acitretin.  If the final plan is for her to restart the HPV Trap, she will return to clinic in 2 weeks to restart the drug.   All adverse events reviewed and discussed with Dr. Abdul Sater

Abnormal labs and clinical symptoms noted but none are considered clinically significant/SAE/AESI  unless otherwise noted in physician and RN notes. All AE's and attributions reviewed and approved by attending physician.   Patient states she feels her leg muscle weakness continues to slowly improve, denies any falls in past several weeks.  Patient again reports ""soft stools"" 3-4 x daily, intermittently,  since she had her colonoscopy performed. Instructed patient to decrease her probiotic yogurt consumption to see if this improves any.  Patient will continue to have treatment held due to potential GI bleeding and on prednisone but agrees to begin prednisone taper as instructed. Patient has Neurology consult and PT/OT scheduled for later today. Schedule and plan reviewed with patient, who verbalized understanding. Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks per protocol schedule.  Asked patient to clarify when she stopped taking Lasix -- patient states she stopped taking this at the same time she stopped taking the gabapentin, around the end of January 2019.  Patient denies any recent episodes of palpitations which were associated with her earlier ascites.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 9	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents accompanied by her mother and father for week 9 clinic visit  yesterday, 04/09/19; required labs were collected on 04/08/19.  Dr. Khan reconciled her concomitant medications; reviewed  all prior and current adverse event complaints; and performed her physical exam.  Her findings are documented in her progress note.  Dr. Strauss and Dr. Abdul Sater met with patient and her family; reviewed her lab results for today, discussed her adverse events and current status.  They advised her that with her continued oral mucositis, which was probably related to M7824, they will continue to hold her  treatment for week #9.  They also discussed the several options as it relates to her future treatment.  They did request and got a consult with the Developmental Therapeutics team during this visit to discuss what potential clinical trials patient may be eligible for in the event that there is confirmed disease progression on her next restaging scan in a few weeks.  Because patient has now permanently relocated to Maryland to be near her parents, they suggested she find a local oncologist to establish care outside of NIH.  Patient and her parents agreed with this suggestion.    Based on her results, specifically her continued anemia, she was scheduled and received a blood transfusion today. The patient did have an Ultra Sound of her right leg yesterday  due to increased swelling; this was positive for a DVT.  Her dose of Lovenox was adjusted up with this new finding. Planned urology consult was completed today.  Patient will return to clinic in one week for a follow up visit to monitor her anemia. Patient and family knows to contact treatment team if her status changes.  All adverse events were reviewed and discussed with Dr. Strauss

Dr. Puthiamadathil reconciled her current home medications, reviewed reported adverse events, and performed her physical exam.  His findings are documented in the patient progress note.  Dr. Abdul Sater met with patient, reviewed her labs, discussed her reported adverse events, and current status.  She currently has her right biliary drain attached to a drainage bag, the left one is capped.  Dr. Abdul Sater advised patient that due to her elevated ALT, which is a grade 2, he will hold week 3 dose of the M7824.  He discussed the possibility that the elevation may be due to the M7824 or it could be due to her history of hepatic/biliary duct obstruction due to her disease.  He wants her liver panel repeated in one week and results faxed to us.  Patient advised that it would be better to have her primary care MD collect the labs verses her oncologist, since that office is in her town.  Research nurse will contact PCP's office to request the labs for 8/26 or 8/27.  Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for week # 5 visit.  All adverse events reviewed with Dr. Abdul Sater

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Telephone follow up call	
Protocol  Documentation	Research nurse called patient to discuss patient's email regarding her follow up with her local Interventional Radiology on Thursday, 8/22/19.  She had an appointment to evaluate both her biliary/hepatic drains.  She states the radiologist capped the left drain and left the right on connected to the bag to drain.  Later in the evening on Thursday the left drain started to leave at the insertion site and she developed fever and chills, similar to the last time she was capped.  She went to the ED, arrived at 6 pm on Thursday, blood work was done; which all came back within normal lists except for elevated liver panel results.  She was discharged home from the ED on Friday at 2 pm, on a 7 day course of Cefuroxime axetil 500 mg, which she started on Saturday, 08/24/19.  She is currently at work, and both drains are attached to drainage bags, she has not had any fever, chills, or leakage of the left drain since discharge.  Patient will return to NIH for next visit on 09/03/19.  She is scheduled to have hepatic panel done tomorrow with results faxed to research nurse.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 5	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents accompanied by a friend for week # 5 of treatment on the clinical trial; required labs were completed.  Dr. Wooley reconciled her current home medications, reviewed reported adverse events, and performed her physical exam.  His findings are documented in the patient progress note.  Dr. Gatti-Mays met with patient, reviewed her labs, discussed her reported adverse events, and current status.  Patient had an ED visit on 08/22/19, due to fever that was possible related to her biliary drains.  During that visit, Interventional Radiology evaluated both drains and cultures were performed on the biliary fluids. She was discharged home on oral antibiotics less than 24 hours after the ED admit.   Dr. Strauss, the study PI determined that this ED visit did not need to be reported as a SAE .  In reviewing the lab results Dr. Gatti-Mays advised patient that her liver enzymes were still elevated and the team plans to continue to hold her M7824 at this time. She discussed with patient the rationale for the continued hold which is for her safety; with the possibility of the elevated enzymes related to both the M7824 and her disease.   Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for week 7 restaging scans and clinic visit.  Will follow up with patient on the result of the biliary fluids culture and urine culture.  All adverse events reviewed with Dr. Gatti-Mays.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week #7	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents accompanied by her husband for week # 7 clinic visit, required labs and restaging CT scans were completed on 09/16/19, and clinic visit on 09/17/19.  Dr. Wooley reconciled her current home medications, reviewed reported adverse events, and performed her physical exam.  His findings are documented in the patient progress note.  The M7824 study drug has been on hold since week # 3 (08/20/19), due to increasing liver enzymes.  Dr. Abdul Sater met with patient, reviewed her labs, discussed her reported adverse events, and current status.  He reviewed the results of her CT scans, and her disease is stable at this time. The patient had both her right biliary drain and her left hepatic drain upsized by her local interventional radiologist on 09/09/19.  Since then, she has noticed oral fluids and food particles are refluxing into the right biliary drain, every time she eats.  Because of this, she is not absorbing the nutrients she needs; she is dehydrated and she has lost 7 lbs since her last visit.  Dr. Abul Sater discussed this new finding with the patient and her husband; the decision was made to admit her for dehydration and further evaluation of the right drain.  Her liver enzymes are still elevated, thus the week # 7 dose of M7824 will be held.   Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for follow up unless these plan change based on her current admission.   All adverse events reviewed with Dr. Abdul Sater

Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 9	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents accompanied by a friend for week # 9 clinic visit, required labs were completed.    Dr. Wooley reconciled her current home medications, reviewed reported adverse events, and performed her physical exam.  His findings are documented in the patient progress note.  The M7824 study drug has been on hold since week # 3 (08/20/19), due to increasing liver enzymes.  There was also a recent episode of biliary drain reflux due to malfunction of drainage from upsized drain right biliary drain; this caused additional lab abnormalities of increasing amylase and lipase, dehydration and altered nutrition.  This caused week #7 dose of the study drug to be held.  Dr. Abdul Sater met with patient, reviewed her labs, discussed her reported adverse events, and current status.  Patients right billary drain is now functioning properly; she is able to eat and drink, no reflux of food/fluids into drain.  She received and completed palliative radiation, from 9/25/19 to 10/1/19, of the hepatic/biliary obstruction.  Dr. Abdul Sater advised her that her liver enzyme elevation have improved, and prior pancreatic enzyme elevation are also improved. All other lab abnormalities if not addressed are not clinically significant. Based on her current status, Dr. Abdul Sater has approved her week #9 treatment of M7824.  The patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for clinic and next treatment visit.  Research nurse reinforced that she should call the treatment team if her status changes.

Reason For Visit	On-study note; Treatment note; Week # 1	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient accompanied by his sister, presented for Week # 1 of treatment with M7824 investigational drug product. Patient has been deemed eligible for protocol 18-C-0056, he signed the inform consent document; and will receive his first treatment with M7824 today.  Protocol eligibility checklist reviewed and verified by Dr. Julius Strauss.  The calculated Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance is 81ml/min, based on current height, weight, and serum creatinine from 11/12/19 screening labs.   Dr. Desai performed the physical exam, reviewed medical history including current symptoms, and reconciled home medications, his findings are documented in the patient progress note.   Dr. Strauss discussed the possible side effects and possible toxicities of the investigational drug product as noted in the informed consent document.  He reinforced use of barrier method for contraception while on the clinical trial.  He discussed and explained symptom management; including calling the treatment team or after hours covering provider to report side effects immediately at onset. The patient does have a Titanium Portacath, thus the M7824 will be infused via his Portacath.  Research nurse provided patient with the study calendar of visits and the important phone numbers to contact the research treatment team and after-hours solid tumor covering provider and page operator.  The patient and family member were given the opportunity to ask questions, which were all addressed to their satisfaction.  The patient will return in 2 weeks for week # 3 clinic and treatment visit.  Baseline Findings/Symptoms: Gastrointestinal Reflux Disease (GERD), grade 2, since 2018 after his radiation treatment, thus related to radiation and not disease; sometimes causes intermittent nausea.  He was on Omeprazole in the past, but was not at this visit.  Prescription entered for Omeprazole as part of GERD regimen.  Patient refused antiemetic, states any nausea is due to his GERD, and is rare.   Serum creatinine, grade 1, increased due to prior history of renal insufficiency related to Cisplatin chemotherapy in 2018, not related to disease.  Hypothyroidism grade 2, related to prior radiation therapy and probably not disease; currently on Synthroid, TSH is elevated at baseline, will monitor. Tinnitus, intermittent, grade 1, onset in 2018 after receiving chemotherapy, thus not related to disease.

Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week 45 follow up	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents accompanied by her husband for her Week #45 follow up visit; her M7824 study drug has been on hold due to central adrenal insufficiency; she continues on oral steroid treatment, hydrocortisone, for this.  Her required labs completed, Dr. Khan reconciled the patient's concomitant medications; reviewed all prior and new adverse events; and performed the patient's physical assessment.  Her findings are documented in the patient progress note.  Dr. Strauss met with patient, he reviewed her lab results for today, discussed adverse events and her current status. Patient has no new complaints at this time, with the warmer weather, she has been more active and is gardening.  All labs were within normal limits, and patient will continue at the prescribed dose of oral steroid for her adrenal insufficiency, 15 mg in the am and 5 mg  in the pm.  Her study drug M7824 hold will continue at this time. Dr Strauss advised patient that the protocol does allow for the lengthening of some required assessments for logistical reasons.  Since her M7824 hold continues, and her status has been stable; he advised patient that her next follow up visit can be in 4 weeks instead of 2 weeks.  Patient and her husband were agreeable with this.  Thus she will return to clinic in 4 week for restaging CT scan and clinic visit.  Research nurse confirmed that patient will still keep her Audiology and ENT consult visits for 04/09/19 and 04/10/19.  Patient advised to contact team if her status changes.  All adverse events reviewed and discussed with Dr. Strauss.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 5	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient accompanied by his wife presented for week # 5 clinic and treatment on M7824; required labs were completed.  Dr. Clara reconciled home medications, assessed for adverse events, and performed the patient's physical exam.  His findings are documented in the patient's progress note.  Dr. Floudas met with patient, reviewed lab results, adverse events, and current status. The patient's labs results showed anemia and increasing liver enzyme results.   Dr. Floudas discussed these findings with the patient and his wife; advised that the M7824 dose for week #5 would be held because of this.  He reinforced that should patient  have increased dyspnea and fatigue more than he is experiencing now, he should contact his local oncologist to have labs drawn to repeat his complete blood count.  All other labs results are within normal limits, or if not addressed, are not clinically significant or are stable per baseline.  Research nurse gave patient supples for collection of an occult blood stool sample, if possible prior to him returning home tomorrow.  Also reinforced for patient to contact research team if his status changes.  Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for restaging scan and week # 7 clinic visit.  All adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Floudas.

General/Protocol Information 
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Day #29	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents for Day 29 clinic visit, required CT scans, routine+ research labs, and ECG were completed.  Dr. Jenkins reconciled all home medications, assessed for adverse events, and performed the patients physical exam.  Her findings are documented in the patients progress note.  Dr. Gatti-Mays and the research nurse talked with patient on teleconference line with Dr. Jenkins.  Dr. Gatti-Mays reviewed the labs results, adverse events, and patients current status.  Dr. Gatti-Mays discussed the scan results; advising patient she does have 2 new small liver lesions, thus disease progression.  She discussed switching the HPV Trap, 18C0056 study and patient was agreeable with this, since she had received the consent prior to coming to NIH for screening.  All prior adverse events have resolved including lab abnormalities. Her urinalysis (UA) was repeated after oral hydration with 1.5 liters of water as directed earlier today after initial UA result.  The repeated UA showed proteinuria had resolved  and bacteruria decreased, thus not clinically significant. Patient advised she does have mild intermittent hematuria, which she states she normally gets when she does strenuous exercise; she did take a 45 minute brisk walk yesterday, this will be noted as part of her baseline medical history.  She states her episodes of hematuria started after her left ureteral stent was placed in June 2018. Dr. Gatti-Mays advised patient she will be consented and treated on the new protocol tomorrow, 4/8/20.   The plan is for patient to return to clinic in 2 weeks, for next dose on the new study, pending any changes scheduling based on COVID-19 restrictions.  All adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Gatti-Mays.

Reason For Visit	Week #1 Treatment follow up telephone calll	
Protocol  Documentation	Research nurse spoke with patient, two days post her first infusion on the study, she states she tolerated the infusion well.  She states she has 3 items to discuss,  two of which she is trying to address with her local oncologist today:  Her history of right lower extremity lymphedema and  new right side/right rib cage area muscle spasms.  She also has new onset of pruritis to bilateral arms.  Right lower extremity lymphedema has be chronic since she developed her first DVT in 12/2016.  She has noticed within the last 4 months the swelling has increased.  Research nurse asked if patient wore compression hose while flying this week; she did not because she finds them uncomfortable.  She now has increased swelling and discomfort and just spoke with her local oncologist about coming in so they can assess her leg.  She states they did discuss ordering an Ultra Sound as part of this evaluation.  She states she is scheduled to meet the Lymphedema Therapist on 12/26/18.  She also reports a possible muscle strain, while standing and stretching on the flight back home yesterday, 12/19/18.  She started to experience intermittent muscle spasm to her right side and rib cage area, since returning home, and the duration has been frequent.  She just notified her oncologist office and they plan to call her back with a possible prescription of either pain medication or muscle relaxant.  She also reports new onset of itching to bilateral arms, from her wrist to her elbow; which started last night. The itching is intermittent, she denies pain, rash, or redness to her arms, denies chills or fever.  She had an episode last night and another this morning.  Research nurse advised patient to call her NIH treatment team if her status changes.  Advised her I will follow up with her next Monday, 12/24/18, to get an update on her status.

General/Protocol Information:
Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week # 3	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient presents for week of treatment; required labs were collected.  Dr. Monge Bonilla performed patient's physical exam, her findings are documented in the patient progress note.  All concomitant medications were reviewed and reconciled.   Patient states she tolerated her week 1 day 1 of treatment well, she did not experience any infusional reactions.   As documented in prior telephone contact note with the research nurse, she did experience a possible muscle strain when standing to stretch on her flight home 2 weeks ago (12/19/18), which caused intermittent muscle spasms.  She also experienced increased swelling to her right lower extremity starting the day after she returned home.  She visited her primary oncologist for both complaints. An ultrasound was performed at a local urgent care center, she was diagnosed with new deep vein thrombosis to the right lower extremity.  Her oncologist discontinued her Eliquis and started her on Lovenox, he also prescribed Baclofen for her muscle spasms.  Dr. Abdul Sater reviewed today's lab result, patient does have an elevated ALT.  Based on further inquiry by Dr. Monge Bonilla, patient admits she has been taking significant daily doses of Tylenol for right groin pain related to her new lower extremity DVT.  Dr. Adul Sater advised patient that based on this elevation in her ALT, the protocol guidance is for her week 3 treatment to be held today.  She has to immediately stop taking Tylenol for pain; she does have a follow up with her oncologist this Friday.  Dr. Adbul Sater will contact him about other pain control options due to elevated ALT. The plan is for her to repeat the liver function panel at home in one week to re-evaluate level.  She will return to clinic in 2 weeks for her scheduled visit and week 5 of treatment if her labs are within normal limits.

Reason For Visit	Off-treatment note	
Protocol  Documentation	Per Dr. Abdul Sater's conversation with patient's primary oncologist and patient's husband (documented his progress note), the patient has made the decision not to return to NIH for treatment on the protocol and as of today will be off treatment.  Because of her decision, it is not feasible for her to complete the required end of treatment assessments, or the 28 day post treatment safety assessments.  The only adverse event that may have been related to the investigational drug product, has resolved as noted with the repeat of blood work on 1/4/19, to reassess her elevated liver enzyme.

Reason For Visit	Treatment note; Week 31	
Protocol  Documentation	Patient accompanied by her daughter, presented for week # 31 of treatment, required restaging scan and routine labs were completed.  Dr. Adams reconciled home medications, assessed for adverse events, and performed the patient's physical exam.  Her findings are documented in the patient's progress note.    Dr. Abdul Sater and research nurse spoke with patient via teleconference with Dr. Adams.  Dr. Strauss reviewed preliminary scan results, labs results, adverse events and patient's current status.  Dr. Sater discussed the results of her scan, which showed growth of a lymph node that  is not measurable, but was on a prior scan. He discussed restaging her in 4 week to evaluate the lymph node.  She continues to have symptoms associated with Adrenal Insufficiency (AI), which was diagnosed on 05/26/20 at an off scheduled visit. Per Dr. Abdul Sater's notes on 5/26/20, the AI is probably related to the M7824 study drug. These AI symptoms include; Fatigue, nausea/vomiting, myalgias, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain.  She was started on hydrocortisone 15 mg (10 mg in am and 5 mg in pm) daily for her AI on 05/26/20.   Her labs results  are within normal limits, any abnormalities, if not addressed are not clinically significant or are stable per baseline.  Based on current status and her AI symptoms Dr. Sater advised patient that her M7824 will be held today and possible subsequent visits, while her AI is controlled.    Research nurse reinforced to patient and her daughter to call the research team if her status changes.  Dr. Adams provided patient with a handout on AI and how to monitor her symptoms at home. She was also prescribed an emergency kit with hydrocortisone injection.  Patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks for week # 33 clinic visit.    All adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Abdul Sater.
