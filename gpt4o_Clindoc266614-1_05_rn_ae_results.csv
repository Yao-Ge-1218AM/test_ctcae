**Explanation:**
Based on the clinical note provided, there are no new or worsening adverse events (AEs) reported during this visit. The patient has recovered from prior adverse events, including lower left abdominal pain (resolved with tumor resection) and rash/lichenoid dermatitis (resolved with only scarring remaining). Bell's Palsy and skin toxicities were previously documented, and there is no indication in the note that these conditions have worsened or re-emerged. Therefore, no new or worsening AEs were identified for extraction."

Explanation: Based on the provided clinical note, there are no explicitly documented **new or worsening adverse events** that emerged or worsened after the start of treatment with M7824. The note mentions the patient's non-adherence to prescribed pain medication and subsequent rebound pain at night, but this appears to be related to her medication regimen rather than a new or worsening adverse event directly attributable to the treatment (M7824). Additionally, the adverse events summary is stated to follow in another progress note, which may contain relevant information not included in this text."

### Notes:
1. **Bronchial infection**: The recurrence of symptoms related to the bronchial infection was reported after treatment started. While the patient had a prior diagnosis, the recurrence is considered a new event.
2. **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Elevated creatinine levels were attributed to prior Cisplatin treatment, but the AKI is noted as ongoing and stable. It is included as it may have worsened after treatment initiation."

### Notes:
1. **Infusional reaction**: Clearly linked to the study drug (m7824) as it led to the drug being placed on hold.
2. **Fatigue**: Patient reported fatigue affecting ADLs, which improved recently. This was attributed to radiation treatment.
3. **Skin toxicities**: Resolving, likely related to radiation treatment.
4. **Pruritus**: Resolved, also likely related to radiation treatment.

No grades were explicitly mentioned in the note, so they are marked as ""Not specified."""

Explanation: Based on the clinical note provided, there are no new or worsening adverse events explicitly mentioned. The note states that the patient's urinary symptoms have resolved, her ANC lab results have improved, and her lab abnormalities from baseline remain stable. Additionally, Dr. Strauss did not consider her ANC clinically significant based on her history of leukopenia at baseline. Therefore, no new or worsening adverse events were identified in this document."

**Explanation:**
The clinical note does not document any new or worsening adverse events (AEs) that emerged after the start of treatment. The note explicitly mentions that the patient's urinary symptoms have resolved, and her ANC (absolute neutrophil count) has improved since the last visit. Additionally, the leukopenia is noted as a baseline condition, and no other new or worsening symptoms are described. Therefore, there are no AEs to extract based on the provided criteria."

### Notes:
1. **Forgetfulness**: The patient reported mild forgetfulness that started after returning from vacation, which is new since the treatment began. It is mapped to CTCAE as ""Forgetfulness"" and graded as 1 (mild). The attribution to m7824 is marked as ""Possible"" since it could be related to the treatment, but no definitive link is established.

2. **Neulasta sensitivity reactions**: The note mentions a history of sensitivity reactions (chills/rigors, diarrhea with abdominal cramping) to Neulasta and Neupogen. However, these are not new or worsening adverse events but rather historical reactions. They are included here for context but are not directly related to m7824.

3. **Other symptoms**: The slight elevation in serum calcium and stable anemia are not considered adverse events as they are not clinically significant or new/worsening.

4. **Grading and Attribution**: Where specific grades or attributions are not explicitly mentioned in the note, reasonable assumptions are made based on the provided information."

### Notes:
1. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)** and **Anemia** are identified as new adverse events because they are explicitly mentioned as reasons for holding the study drug (M7824) and are not described as baseline symptoms.

3. Attribution is inferred based on the context provided:
   - Both MDS and Anemia are likely related to the disease (possible) but are more strongly attributed to the study drug (probable) since the drug was held due to these events.
   - There is no indication of other contributing factors, so ""Related to Other?"" is marked as unlikely."

- **Dyspnea** and **Constipation** are noted as ongoing issues in the clinical note. Since the note does not explicitly state that these symptoms were present at baseline, they are considered new or worsening adverse events.
- Both events are mild (Grade 1) based on the description.
- Attribution is assigned as ""Possible"" for disease-related causes and ""Unlikely"" for drug/device intervention (m7824), as there is no clear evidence linking these symptoms to the intervention. ""Unrelated"" is selected for ""Related to Other?"" since no other contributing factors are mentioned."

### Explanation:
- **Dysphagia**: The note explicitly mentions ""increasing dysphagia,"" indicating a worsening of this symptom. It is therefore considered a new or worsening adverse event.
- **Grade**: The grade is not explicitly mentioned in the note. Based on the clinical context (e.g., treatment being held and pending procedures), it is reasonable to assume at least Grade 2 severity.
- **Attribution**:
  - **Disease Related?**: Marked as ""Probable"" because the worsening dysphagia is likely due to disease progression, as explicitly mentioned in the note.
  - **Drug/Device Intervention?**: Marked as ""Unlikely"" because there is no indication in the note that the intervention (m7824) is contributing to this symptom.
  - **Related to Other?**: Marked as ""Unlikely"" because no other contributing factors are mentioned.

No other adverse events are explicitly described as new or worsening in the note."

1. **Urinary tract infection symptoms** (bladder pressure, burning with urination) and **hematuria** (slight blood in urine) were reported on 3/21/20. These symptoms are considered new adverse events since they were not documented as baseline symptoms prior to treatment.

### Notes:
1. **Diarrhea and Vomiting**: These events were new and occurred after eating at a restaurant. They resolved without intervention and are likely unrelated to the treatment or disease but possibly related to food consumed.
2. **Pruritus**: This symptom is noted to be ongoing but improving. Since it is still present and treatment is being held due to rash and pruritus, it is attributed as ""Probable"" to the drug intervention (m7824). It is graded as 2 due to its impact on treatment continuation."

- **AE Term**: ""Imbalance"" was identified as a worsening symptom since the patient reported that their imbalance issues have increased from baseline after their recent eye procedures.
- **Grade**: Assigned as Grade 1 because the patient stated it is not limiting their self-care ADLs (activities of daily living) any more than previously and no new falls were reported.
- **Attribution**:
  - **Disease Related?**: Marked as ""Possible"" because imbalance could be related to the underlying condition or disease progression.
  - **Drug/Device Intervention?**: Marked as ""Unlikely"" because the study drug treatment (m7824) is currently on hold, making it less likely to be the cause.
  - **Related to Other?**: Marked as ""Unlikely"" since no other clear contributing factors were mentioned in the note.

No other new or worsening adverse events were identified in the clinical note."

### Explanation:
The clinical note specifies that the patient's anemia was ongoing as of 2/26/19 and was retrospectively determined to be **unlikely related to the study drug (M7824)**, **probably related to the disease**, and **probably related to prior radiation, chemotherapies, and Lovenox**. However, there is no indication in the note that the anemia is a **new or worsening adverse event** after the start of treatment with M7824. Therefore, no new or worsening adverse events are extracted from this note."

### Explanation:
Based on the clinical note provided, there are no **new or worsening adverse events** reported during this visit. The patient mentioned that the presence of blood while wiping after bowel movements and discomfort at biliary drain sites had resolved, indicating these were prior adverse events that have improved. No other new or worsening symptoms were documented."
08b7f8ae708607415cb6d91315044748,10/29/19,"Based on the provided clinical note, there is no explicit mention of new or worsening adverse events (AEs) that emerged after the start of treatment with m7824. The note states that ""all adverse events were reviewed with Dr. Strauss,"" but it does not specify any new or worsening symptoms. Additionally, the patient is described as ""doing well,"" with stable restaging scans, no issues with biliary drains, regained weight, and labs within normal limits.

Since no specific new or worsening AEs are documented in the note, the output will be an empty JSON list:

```json
[]
``` 

If there are additional notes or details in other sections of the patient's records, those would need to be reviewed to identify any relevant AEs."

### Notes:
1. The adverse events ""Increased ALT"" and ""Increased AST"" were identified as new or worsening since they led to the holding of the investigational drug (m7824) and the initiation of prednisone treatment. These were not described as baseline symptoms.
2. The grade of the events is not explicitly mentioned in the note, but the intervention (holding the drug and starting prednisone) suggests at least Grade 2 or higher.
3. Attribution to the investigational drug (m7824) is marked as ""Probable"" based on the clinical context, while other potential causes (e.g., herbal supplements or medications) are also considered ""Possible.""
4. No other new or worsening adverse events were documented in the note."

### Explanation:
- **Dyspnea** and **Cough** were noted as ongoing symptoms, but their worsening is implied by the mention of ""mediastinal progression"" on re-staging scans, which is attributed to these symptoms. This suggests they have worsened since baseline.
- Both events are graded as **Grade 2** based on the need for symptom management with albuterol nebulizer and benzonatate.
- Attribution is marked as **""Probable"" for Disease Related** due to the mediastinal progression, and **""Unlikely"" for Drug/Device Intervention** (NSH-IL12) since the progression is attributed to disease rather than the study drug."

### Notes:
1. The adverse event ""dyspnea"" is mentioned as ""increased dyspnea,"" indicating worsening after treatment began.

3. Attribution is based on the context provided:
   - The dyspnea is likely related to disease progression (""disease progression with associated increased dyspnea"").
   - There is no indication that the dyspnea is related to the drug/device intervention (m7824).
   - No other contributing factors are mentioned."

Explanation: Based on the clinical note provided, there are no new or worsening adverse events (AEs) explicitly described. The note mentions abnormal labs and clinical symptoms but states that none are clinically significant, serious adverse events (SAEs), or adverse events of special interest (AESIs) unless otherwise noted. Additionally, the patient is reported as asymptomatic at the time of the visit. Therefore, no new or worsening AEs can be extracted from this note."

### Explanation:
1. **AE Term**: ""Dyspnea on exertion"" was explicitly mentioned as a patient complaint (""c/o increased dyspnea on exertion""). This suggests it is a new or worsening symptom.
2. **Grade**: The grade was not specified in the note. By default, it is assumed to be Grade 1 unless further clarification is provided.
3. **Attribution**:
   - **Disease Related?**: Marked as ""Possible"" because dyspnea could be related to the underlying disease.
   - **Drug/Device Intervention? (Intervention: m7824)**: Marked as ""Possible"" because the study drug could potentially contribute to this symptom.
   - **Related to Other?**: Marked as ""Unlikely"" since no other contributing factors were mentioned in the note.

If additional information about the grade or attribution becomes available, the output should be updated accordingly."

**Explanation:**  
The provided clinical note does not contain specific information about new or worsening adverse events. It only mentions that adverse events were reviewed by the investigator for the visit date (4.9.19) but does not list or describe any specific adverse events, their grades, or attributions. Therefore, no data can be extracted based on the criteria provided."

### Explanation:
The clinical note provided does not explicitly mention any **new or worsening adverse events** that emerged after the start of treatment. The note states that ""abnormal labs and clinical symptoms noted but none clinically significant/SAE/AESI unless otherwise noted in physician and RN notes."" Additionally, the patient's dyspnea on exertion is mentioned, but it is not explicitly described as new or worsening, and it appears to be a baseline symptom since there is no indication that it emerged or worsened after treatment. Therefore, no adverse events meet the criteria for extraction."

**Explanation**:  
The clinical note provided does not document any new or worsening adverse events (AEs) that emerged after the start of treatment with M7824. All symptoms mentioned (e.g., GERD, increased serum creatinine, hypothyroidism, tinnitus) are explicitly described as baseline findings and are attributed to prior treatments or conditions unrelated to the investigational drug. Therefore, no new or worsening AEs were identified for extraction."

### Explanation:
After reviewing the clinical note, there are no **new or worsening adverse events** reported. The patient continues to experience ""left ear fullness,"" which is explicitly noted as residual from a prior upper respiratory infection (URI) episode documented on 02/21/19, predating the treatment. Additionally, the central adrenal insufficiency is a known condition for which the patient is already on oral steroid treatment, and the study drug (M7824) remains on hold due to this pre-existing condition. No other new complaints or adverse events are mentioned in the note."
4013ce1eb4e04dc53415c02629dc6a36,3/26/19,"```json
[]
``` 

Explanation: Based on the clinical note provided, there are no new or worsening adverse events reported. The patient has no new complaints at this time, and her status is described as stable. The central adrenal insufficiency and oral steroid treatment (hydrocortisone) are ongoing issues but were already present prior to this visit and are not described as worsening. Therefore, no new or worsening adverse events are identified for extraction."
4013ce1eb4e04dc53415c02629dc6a36,3/28/19,"Based on the provided clinical note, there is no specific mention of new or worsening adverse events (AEs) or detailed descriptions of symptoms. The note primarily discusses a correction to prior records of AEs without providing explicit information about the AEs themselves. Therefore, no extractable AEs can be identified from this text.

If additional clinical notes or details are provided that include descriptions of new or worsening AEs, I can assist in extracting and formatting them accordingly."

[]
``` 

**Explanation:**  
The provided clinical note does not mention any new or worsening adverse events.

There are no references to symptoms or adverse events that emerged or worsened after the start of treatment."

Explanation: Based on the clinical note provided, there are no new or worsening adverse events (AEs) documented. The note explicitly states that abnormal labs and clinical symptoms were noted but none were clinically significant, serious adverse events (SAEs), or adverse events of special interest (AESIs). Additionally, the patient reports improvement in fatigue, resolution of ear fullness, and resolution of myalgia, which indicates no new or worsening symptoms. Therefore, no AEs meet the criteria for extraction."

Additionally, the patient's increased appetite and weight gain are mentioned, but these are attributed to her use of a dietary supplement, not the intervention (m7824). Therefore, no adverse events meet the criteria for extraction."

### Notes:
- The clinical note mentions ""increasing dry eyes,"" which suggests this is a **worsening adverse event**. However, the grade and attribution are not explicitly provided in the note and are pending review with the Principal Investigator (PI).
- No other specific adverse events are detailed in the provided text. The note refers to ""several AEs"" but does not list them explicitly. These would need to be reviewed in the prescriber note mentioned in the text for further extraction."
4013ce1eb4e04dc53415c02629dc6a36,4/5/21,"Based on the provided clinical note, there is no mention of specific adverse events (AEs) that emerged or worsened after the start of treatment. The note primarily discusses the patient's absence from a scheduled protocol visit due to COVID-19 travel precautions and ongoing treatment hold. There are no details about new or worsening symptoms or adverse events in the text.

If you have additional clinical notes or sections that include information about adverse events, please provide them, and I will assist in extracting the relevant data."

### Notes:
1. The clinical note does not specify the grade or attribution for the adverse events (AEs) of ""dry eye"" and ""fatigue."" These details would need to be clarified after review with the Principal Investigator (PI), as mentioned in the note.
2. Both ""dry eye"" and ""fatigue"" are listed as AEs that led to a treatment hold, suggesting they are new or worsening since the start of treatment.
3. If additional context or clarification is provided, the output can be updated accordingly."

- The clinical note specifies that adverse events (AEs) will be reviewed with the Principal Investigator (PI) to determine grades and attributions. Therefore, placeholders (""To be determined by PI"") are used for these fields.
- Both ""dry eye"" and ""fatigue"" are listed as AEs leading to a treatment hold, suggesting they are new or worsening since the start of treatment."

1. **Constipation** and **exertional dyspnea** were explicitly mentioned as ongoing issues, but since the note does not clarify whether they were baseline symptoms or worsened during treatment, they are conservatively included as new or worsening AEs.
2. **Disease progression** is a clear worsening condition and is attributed primarily to the disease itself.
3. **Bleeding risk** is mentioned as a safety concern and is included as a new AE, likely related to both disease and treatment.

### Explanation:
- **Pruritus (Itching)**: The note explicitly mentions that the patient decided not to have the study drug infusion due to itching, which is improving but still unresolved. This suggests that the itching is a new or worsening adverse event after the start of treatment.
- **Grade**: The severity of the itching is not explicitly stated, but since the patient is still debating whether to continue treatment and the symptom is described as ""improving,"" it is reasonable to classify it as Grade 1 (mild).
- **Attribution**:
  - **Disease Related**: Unlikely, as there is no indication that the itching is related to the underlying disease.
  - **Drug/Device Intervention**: Possible, as the patient is on hold from the study drug due to this symptom, suggesting a potential link.
  - **Related to Other**: Unlikely, as no other cause is mentioned in the note.

### Explanation:
1. **Dizziness**: This is a new symptom mentioned in the note (""recent dizziness episodes""). It is mapped to CTCAE terminology and graded as mild (Grade 1). Attribution is assessed based on the context provided.
2. **Pancytopenia**: This condition is noted as ongoing and treatment is being held due to it. It is assumed to have worsened after treatment initiation, as it is significant enough to impact treatment decisions. Graded as moderate (Grade 2).
3. **Anemia**: Similarly, anemia is noted as a reason for iron infusion and treatment hold. It is assumed to have worsened after treatment initiation. Graded as moderate (Grade 2).

### Notes:
- Only new or worsening AEs after treatment initiation are included.
- Attribution is based on the available context, with assumptions made conservatively.
- Grades are assigned based on CTCAE guidelines and clinical interpretation of severity."
